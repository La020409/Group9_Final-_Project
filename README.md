# Group9_Final _Project
Project Description:

In this project, we analyzed ride data from NYC Yellow Taxis and Uber between January 2020 and August 2024, combining it with historical weather information. The process involved downloading and cleaning large datasets, generating representative samples using Cochranâ€™s formula, and normalizing the data for efficient storage in a SQLite database. We then used SQL queries to explore key analytical questions, such as identifying peak ride hours, examining how weather conditions influenced ride patterns, and studying how factors like distance and precipitation affected tipping behavior. To visualize trends and patterns, we created various visualizations, including time-series graphs, scatter plots, and a geospatial heatmap.
